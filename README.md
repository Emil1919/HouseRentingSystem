The House Renting System is a comprehensive GitHub project developed using C#, Bootstrap, and a SQL database. This application aims to streamline the process of renting houses by providing a user-friendly platform for both landlords and tenants. The system allows landlords to list available properties, complete with details such as location, amenities, and rental terms. Tenants can easily search and view available houses, submit rental applications, and communicate with landlords. The use of C# ensures a robust and scalable backend, while Bootstrap ensures a responsive and visually appealing frontend. The integration with a SQL database enables efficient storage and retrieval of property and user information, ensuring a seamless and organized house renting experience. The project is designed for flexibility, making it suitable for customization based on specific needs and requirements. # HouseRentingSystem
